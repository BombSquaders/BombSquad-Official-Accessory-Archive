<h2 align="center">Info</h2>

This repository is for storing BombSquad game's new custom models, textures and scripts of
 installing more new characters and maps, to make it easily manageable and accessible by the players
 of BombSquad to get their favourite map and characters. This repository is inspired by the
 `BombSquad-Community-Mod-Manager`.

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

Save and put this link [`accInstaller.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/I-Am-The-Great/BombSquad-Official-Accessory-Archive/master/utils/accInstaller.py )
 in your BombSquad's mods folder, and then reload your bombSquad game.

<h2 align="center">Working</h2>

When you reload your BombSquad game after putting our [`accInstaller.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/I-Am-The-Great/BombSquad-Official-Accessory-Archive/master/utils/accInstaller.py )
 in your BombSquad's mod folder, it will install two files: `accManager.py` and `accAssistor.py`.
 The `accAssistor.py` will add the button and icon of `Accessories Manager Window` on the main
 menu screen of the BombSquad game and when that button is clicked it will then call the `AccManagerWindow`
 present in the `accManager.py`, this will be some similar to the `BombSquad-Community-Mod-Manager`'s
 window, it will contain the list of every individual characters' and maps' name which you can install
 in just a click.
