<h2 align="center">This repository's aim</h2>
This repository is for storing BombSquad game's new custom models, textures and scripts of
 installing more new characters and maps, to make it easily manageable and accessible by the players
 of BombSquad to get their favourite map and characters. This repository is inspired by the
 `BombSquad-Community-Mod-Manager`.

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>
Save and put this link [`accInstaller.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/I-Am-The-Great/BombSquad-Official-Accessory-Archive/master/utils/accInstaller.py )
 in your BombSquad's mods folder, and then reload your bombSquad game.

<h2 align="center">Working</h2>
When you reload your BombSquad game after putting our [`accInstaller.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/I-Am-The-Great/BombSquad-Official-Accessory-Archive/master/utils/accInstaller.py )
 in your BombSquad's mod folder, it will install two files: `accManager.py` and `accAssistor.py`.
 The `accAssistor.py` will add the button and icon of `Accessories Manager Window` on the main
 menu screen of the BombSquad game and when that button is clicked it will then call the `AccManagerWindow`
 present in the `accManager.py`, this will be some similar to the `BombSquad-Community-Mod-Manager`'s
 window, it will contain the list of every individual characters' and maps' name which you can install
 in just a click.

<h2 align="center">Some F.A.Q.</h2>

### How to install it?
Save and put this link [`accInstaller.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/I-Am-The-Great/BombSquad-Official-Accessory-Archive/master/utils/accInstaller.py )
 in your BombSquad's mods folder, and then reload your bombSquad game.

### How will it work?
When you reload your BombSquad game after putting our [`accInstaller.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/I-Am-The-Great/BombSquad-Official-Accessory-Archive/master/utils/accInstaller.py )
 in your BombSquad's mod folder, it will install two files: `accManager.py` and `accAssistor.py`.
 The `accAssistor.py` will add the button and icon of `Accessories Manager Window` on the main
 menu screen of the BombSquad game and when that button is clicked it will then call the `Accessories Archive Manager Window`
 present in the `accManager.py`, this will be some similar to the `BombSquad-Community-Mod-Manager`'s
 window, it will contain the list of every individual characters' and maps' name which you can install
 in just a click.

### So will you just include anyone's work without even consulting them?  
No, we will never include anyone's work without their proper permission, we might ask some creators
 for their permissions to include their work's copy in our repository, if they deny we will not
 disturb them again and if they agree then we will add their work in this repository with proper
 copyright mentions and all details of their work in the [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/I-Am-The-Great/BombSquad-Official-Accessory-Archive/blob/master/contributor.md ).

### Why are you asking for support?
Well, as you know our work is an open source project, and we have a low monthly budget, so to maintain
 this project and keep it running as it is or even better we need some support from our users.

### What if I mistakenly deleted a character or map?
If you deleted it using our `Accessories Manager`, there will be a backup of the file or files of that
 accessory in your BombSquad game's mods folder, just find the file/files (it is easy to find them
 they will have similar name to the accessory), the after finding the file/files remove `.bak`
 from the end of name of each file; else if you deleted the accessory using your file manager, then
 redownload that accessory using our `Accessories Manager`.

### What will you do with the money we give to support this project?
That money will keep storing in our PayPal accounts, and whenever we have to pay to improve this project
 or to keep this project running we will use that.

### What if no person donate their money in supporting this project?
We do not force any user to donate their money to us to support our project, it is the user's choice
 and totally dependent on the user, and if no person donate their money in supporting this project
 then also this project will be running.

### Why is this repository named `Archive` and why not `Manager`?
Well, basically this repository is a collection of BombSquad's extra accessories and in-built
 accessories for helping the BombSquad game's players to get every accessory of BombSquad they want
 in a single place, also there is `BombSquad Offical Accessories Manager` which stands for the mod
 product of this repository to let the BombSquad game's players manage the accessories even while
 playing BombSquad, the mod's script is `accManager.py`.

### I also wish to contribute here, what should I do?
Well, if you want to contribute to this repository then you may do that by all means possible, like
 through issues or pull requests, do not hesitate to open an issue or a pull requests contributors are
 most welcome here, but the issue or pull request must also be meaningful.

### What will you get in doing this?
Well, basically we will get happiness and motivation for new projects if the players enjoy using our
 work and it work correctly.
