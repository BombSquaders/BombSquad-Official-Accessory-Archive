BombSquad Official Accessory Archive and Accessories Manager has been designed
as a service for BombSquad players to easily organise the accessories of the BombSquad game
like new models/textures and/or characters/maps on their local device. Please keep this
in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not
something that most people will use, we probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask.
